Throughout physical installations, architectural and furniture design, construction R&D and digital art, Nicholas Préaud''s work comes together as one broad unclassifiable contemporary discipline. A discipline that sets out to question our ways of life, our ways of interacting with our environment and each other, and to question the traditional rollout of creative architectural processes.
Nicholas Préaud’s fondness for furniture and product design brings him satisfaction on different scales in different timelines. The liberty and authority these designs lend him feed his creativity to break through the boundaries between what exists in the digital and physical world. In fact, some of his projects touch upon abstraction, works that only serve the digital altar. As he investigates, researches, and develops plans and methods to bring these digital works to life, Nicholas Préaud finds himself invested and knee-deep in his design and work principles, an indication of a positive intensification in his design, architecture, and construction research and development.
Nicholas Préaud pursued architecture studies in Paris and subsequently worked in several architecture firms such as DGT Architects, Lina Ghotmeh Architecture, Nicolas Laisné Architectes, and more recently Sou Fujimoto Architects in Paris. His background is purely architectural and bridges several practices such as architecture, smaller-scale furniture or product design, and construction R&D to more abstract and digital works of design meant to exist only digitally. Some projects such as Casa Atibaia are ways of bridging the gap between the digital and the physical world. Initiated as a digital architectural project, Nicholas Préaud is now working on bringing it to life in the years to come.', 'France / USA', '', 'Architecture / Design', '0x7cd7c177b20c3c94926ddff0030d1ac2d9fe83ed', '2023-01-23 22:56:24.836839+00', '2023-06-02 10:11:20.905742+00', '{"interview": [{"a": "My main inspiration comes from Brazilian and Japanese architecture and their sheer, essential relationship with nature. My work is impregnated with many references to East Asian culture, and specifically Japanese culture. Having been very passionate about the Japanese culture and architecture for my entire life, and having worked at internationally renowned studios led by Japanese architects such as Tsuyoshi Tane or Sou Fujimoto, I have learnt a lot about, and continue to seek to learn about how architectural design can entertain an essential relationship with its foundational natural counterpart. A simple relationship between the artefact and the untouched, and layouts intentionally designed to encompass empty space where anything can happen are essential to me, as opposed to Western architecture and its spaces imposing a function on the user. The concept of ‘Ma’ in Japanese culture and architecture points to this exactly. The invisible aesthetic of Ma is portrayed by this energy filled with possibilities emerging from the design. An emptiness which reveals unforeseen function(s). This doesn’t mean of course that my work necessarily “looks” Japanese, but it carries some of those concepts.", "q": "What are your inspirations ?"}, {"a": "I usually don’t iterate so much during the design process nore do I start with an already envisioned product or project. A concept often emerges early on because it makes sense, and is then pushed further until completion. I believe there are as many valid concepts as there are approaches to the same project. It’s just a matter of it making sense to the final users of the space or product, and of course to you the designer. Depending on the scale and complexity of the project, iterations and revisions are nevertheless bound to happen. This is where engineering and construction knowledge proves useful in the design process as it brings the final design closer to that realistic, tangible feeling which makes the work interesting and draws curiosity. ", "q": "What is your creative process ?"}, {"a": "Digital art for me is the way of expressing ideas involving unbuilt or yet to be built architecture. As a young designer, it has become crucial to be able to express the countless concepts and ideas that would otherwise be shelved or forgotten on account of not materializing through the process of design and imagery. These fictitious imaginary spaces absolutely nourish my real-life practice with the references and things that I might have imagined, that actually can translate into real-life construction. It basically extends the artistic possibilities with projects that aren''t necessarily commissioned or paid for by a client. It is a way to conduct research.", "q": "What does digital art mean to you ?"}, {"a": "My most challenging project has been and continues to be Casa Atibaia which I designed in collaboration with Charlotte Taylor. This project encapsulates so much of what I try to push towards in my practice. Architecture that does not wish to disappear in its surroundings, nor show off extravagantly either. Architecture that exists through the multiplication of natural forces. Started in early 2020, the project was first rolled out as a way of putting forward ideas and our interpretation of Brazilian modernism. Having lived and studied architecture in Brazil, this project resonates so much with me. Phase one of this project which we rolled out in 2020 was met with great enthusiasm and really gave us extra incentive to continue pushing for it to materialize. Phase two which will be released soon brings us even closer to this imagined dreamhouse, and consists of a short film allowing the viewer to immerse themselves completely in the design in a way the still shots didn’t let you. Phase three which we are very optimistic about will be rolled out in the coming years and will materialize through the construction of the house. We have been in discussion over the past year with consultants, investors and collectors who are also guiding us through the process.", "q": "What''s the project you are most proud of ?"}, {"a": "My craziest  works have to be both of the films I have directed in the past years as they are the medium I am the least familiar with. Coral Arena which was made in Collaboration with OMA and Charlotte Taylor explores the decades-long life of a structure meant to accomodate and replenish coral population in the Miami area. Mixing architectural elements with explosion of marine life was a great challenge and it came out just beautiful. The other film I directed and produced this time alone is a much calmer work of contemplation about a lifeless wood structure coming to life only through the effect of wind.

Together with six friends, as a student in architecture, she founded a collective located passage du Cheval Blanc in the 11th arrondissement of Paris, that combined art, photography, landscape design and architecture, with a common goal: to create bridges between expressions, visions and materials… She started out with living rooms, moved on to houses, and at the age of 22, she was commissioned to reinvent a private mansion. An encounter with a fashion designer led her to work on the concept of 400 stores and corners for the brand worldwide. Other French luxury houses then followed suit: saddle makers, jewellers, fashion designers. In the process, she refined her taste for excellence and heritage. She showcased her work at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Palais d’Iéna and the Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris. Her work is featured in several galleries, while she turns each encounter into a source of inspiration, draws from the art of breath and light, travels through time and asserts her own vision.

Her creations blend rough textured chamotte earthenware and sensual touch cracked enamel she sometimes associates with metal or wood in her immaculate studio-laboratory in the north of Paris. Johanna de Clisson has developed a vocabulary of graphic forms which she explores with HIROMI, a collection of objects such as wall lamps, floor lamps, table lamps and wall modules.
Playing with paradoxes, Johanna de Clisson simultaneously sculpts objects with brutalist and voluptuous shapes and volumes, like two extremes colliding. She signs limited edition furniture (seats, bedside tables, coffee tables) and custom-made light sculptures for special orders from architects. At the frontier between art and design, she claims the beauty of constraint and asceticism as her personal guidelines. Genuine backbone of her research, architecture is the main source of reference for the artist who evokes Ryue Nishizawa, Tadao Ando or Oscar Niemeyer as tutelary figures who guide her in her desire to transcribe architectural forms in everyday life. She also draws inspiration from the artistic current of German objective photography, such as Bernd and Hilla Becher’s typological and serial approach.
It is in a former workshop in the 9th arrondissement of Paris that she develops and exhibits her work. Old wooden ‘parquet’, white walls, buttercloth curtains and a few design pieces compose this silent space. Johanna sculpts dressed in a white blouse, a uniform that frees her spirit and guides her towards the rigor of her work.

Combining the wonders of the natural world with a deep understanding of art and design, they create objects and furniture pieces that singularly combine raw material with aesthetic sophistication.
Totally contemporary but rooted in the primordial earth, their work achieves an exquisite balance between the severe beauty of nature and the complexity of cosmopolitan life.
Guided by the maxim that the piece of furniture is a jewel, they consider each piece''s relationship with the body, space and time.

Then a brief to express the path we intend to follow, and we use simultaneously these two components, observations, and emotions, to guide our thinking along the project.", "q": "What is your creative process ?"}, {"a": "Sensitive to aesthetics, graphics, visual arts, architecture, and design, we have tried to combine these passions within a single box: digital art. Digital art, to us, means ultimate expressive freedom. It is the most current medium to make images in the age in which we live, combining photographic representation with imaginative one. Both of us were immediately fascinated by the power of digital tools to project people into worlds not yet present and to engage with them in new and stimulating ways. The digital tool, if interpreted correctly, is a tool for exploring an idea, offering endless opportunities for experimentation. What is essential for us is that an image has to be culture driven. What we mean is that we try to combine technique with the culture of images, creating a narrative around it. The aim is to communicate a thought through the compositional elements, thus causing emotion in the observer, delivering spaces in which we would like to immerse ourselves first, in which we wish to stay and live.", "q": "What does digital art mean to you ?"}, {"a": "The project we are the proudest of is \"La casa in riva al mare,\" it was a project made to tell what, until that moment, had influenced us the most, a place where we would have loved to be, but also to express our new technical and compositional skills that we learned over the time. It was a challenge for us, and we were really satisfied to see that that project became viral in a short time, exceeding our expectations. The main idea behind the project was that the space had to detach itself from reality somehow, creating a desire for immersion. This detachment is suggested by an unconventional space, the total visual immersion on the horizon of the sea, and the presence of a central swimming pool with giant tents delicately placed along the perimeter of the circular space. The theme was relaxed and was communicated by all the furniture and elements accurately set to enhance this visual journey and convey this feeling.", "q": "What''s the project you are most proud of ?"}, {"a": "Due to NDA agreements, unfortunately, we can''t reveal the name of this project yet, which we think may be the craziest since it has pushed us dramatically out of our comfort zone. We usually work with architectural spaces, but in this case, the client wanted to present his new furniture collection outside the rooms in a surreal natural setting. Therefore we decided to design floating islands that host and stage each product highlighting the internal characteristics making them protagonists interacting with the surrounding nature. The client was so happy about the results that he requested a looping cinematic and a VR experience to communicate and immerse customers completely in those environments. That project helped us to open our eyes and encouraged us to explore new territories that we are interested in following and make other iterations in the future.", "q": "What is your craziest work ?"}, {"a": "The thing that we are most proud of is the possibility of creatively express ourselves, to use imagination, to design, without taking into account the limits of reality, which allowed us in a short time to have the opportunity to share our creative process with customers like Ikea, Harman Kardon, Wallpaper Mag.", "q": "What''s your proudest allegiance ?"}, {"a": "", "q": "How do ideas come to you? :"}, {"a": "", "q": "Any friends you want to see on Monde Singulier ?"}]}', NULL, NULL, NULL, true, false, 29);
